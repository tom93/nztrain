=== Installation
Run +script/install.bash+ to install dependencies.

+script/update.bash+ will pull changes from origin and recompile various things. This includes assets - assuming that it is for production purposes.

Both scripts depends on +script/install.cfg+, which is built using +script/install/config.bash+ automatically. If +script/install.cfg+ is incomplete (eg. new configuration is added), +script/install.bash+ and +script/update.bash+ will prompt for the new configurations required.

=== Development Tools
- +spring+ instead of +bundle exec+ to keep a background copy of rails running, and avoid startup time.
- +unicorn+ starts of a development server (instead of Webrick).
