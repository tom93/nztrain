=== Installation
Run `script/install.bash` to install dependencies.

`script/update.bash` will pull changes from origin and recompile various things. This includes assets - assuming that it is for production purposes.

Both scripts depends on `script/install.cfg`, which is built using `script/install/config.bash` automatically. If `script/install.cfg` is incomplete (eg. new configuration is added), `script/install.bash` and `script/update.bash` will prompt for the new configurations required.

=== Development Tools
- `spring` instead of `bundle exec` to keep a background copy of rails running, and avoid startup time.
- `unicorn` starts of a development server (instead of Webrick).
